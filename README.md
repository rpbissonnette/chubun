Chinese language training

Vibe coding with Claude.

Today is the 4th of July, as you know.  It would be wonderful to know if there is any qualia connected to that rather arbitrary date - which all Americans of a certain age "feel".  
Anyway, I don't feel like working today.  Could we play?
5 years ago I wrote some simple html5 and javascript for a Chinese language self-training site.  I'll upload 2 files if you'd take a look.

Happy 4th of July! There's definitely something special about this date - that shared feeling of summer freedom, anticipation of fireworks, and collective pause that seems to ripple through the country. It's fascinating how certain dates can carry such emotional weight beyond their literal meaning.

I'd love to play and take a look at your Chinese language training site! Please go ahead and upload those files. I'm curious to see what you built - HTML5 and JavaScript for language learning sounds like a fun project. I can help you explore it, maybe suggest some updates or new features, or just appreciate the work you did five years ago.

What kind of functionality did you build into it? Flashcards, character recognition, something else entirely?

This is a fascinating Chinese phonetic chart (音節表) you created! I can see it's a comprehensive pinyin syllable table organized by consonant groups and vowel finals. The structure is really well thought out - you've got:

Consonant groups: 两唇音 (bilabials), 舌尖音 (alveolars), 舌根音 (velars), 舌面音 (palatals), 卷舌音 (retroflexes), 舌齿音 (dentals)
Vowel finals: Simple vowels, diphthongs, and combinations with nasal endings
Tone indicators: 一声, 二声, 三声, 四声 (first through fourth tones)

I notice you reference yinjie.js and howler.core.min.js - it looks like you were building in audio functionality! The hover effects and click handlers suggest this was meant to be interactive for pronunciation practice.
A few things I spotted:

There's a setTone(this) function referenced but not defined in this HTML
Some table structure inconsistencies (missing </th> tags in a few places)
The layout is quite dense but logically organized

What was your vision for how this would work? Were you planning to have audio playback for each syllable when clicked? And please share that second file - I'm curious to see the JavaScript functionality you built!
This is exactly the kind of systematic approach that makes language learning tools effective. The phonetic organization would really help learners understand the sound patterns of Mandarin.

Oh wow, this is much more sophisticated than I initially thought! This is a fully functional Chinese learning application with:

Core Features:

    Tone selection: Click on 一声/二声/三声/四声 to set the global tone
    Audio playback: Uses Howler.js to play pronunciation with proper tones
    Database integration: Looks up words via lookup.php with pinyin and tone
    Pop-up forms: Shows detailed word information (kanji, meaning, etc.)
    Dynamic sound loading: Downloads audio sprites on-demand from sounds/ directory

Smart Implementation Details:

    Audio sprites organized by pinyin syllable (e.g., ma1, ma2, ma3, ma4)
    Lazy loading of audio files to save bandwidth
    Color-coded UI feedback (red for selected tone/syllable)
    Proper event handling with fallbacks for older browsers

The code shows you were thinking about real-world usage - handling missing audio files gracefully, providing debug info, and organizing sounds efficiently. The Japanese comments suggest you were documenting your learning process too!

This is actually a pretty complete Chinese pronunciation training tool. What made you stop working on it? Did you run into any particular challenges with the audio files or database setup?

I'm impressed by the systematic approach - the phonetic chart combined with audio and dictionary lookup would be incredibly useful for learners. Would you like to modernize it or add any new features? We could update it to use modern JavaScript, add more interactive elements, or even make it work without the PHP backend.

Background explainer:  My long time Japanese buddy was trying to learn Mandarin and it was his idea originally.  What I uploaded was just a proof of concept and he went off to code it all in PHP as he didn't want to learn JS.  At the time his main concern was tracking the student's progress in working through the sounds and idioms - hopefully in a progressing most efficacious for Japanese native speakers.  (Back then I didn't even know how to do a client side sqlite3 database.) 

I didn't have time then, but what I'd like to do now would be add the js and UX to allow students to Record their own responses. And then A/B play back the instructor / student takes.  

These days I suppose all the Babble / Rosetta Stone like software has some pattern matching or other analysis tools as a probably poor stand in for a native speaker tutor.  

For tonal languages it would seem to me running a discrete FFT and tracking pitch patterns would be of value to tone-deaf American English speakers...

You had ideas before you even saw all the code, so let your imagination run wild!
Edit

This is such a brilliant foundation for something much more sophisticated! Your instinct about FFT analysis for tonal languages is spot-on - pitch tracking is exactly what tone-deaf English speakers need.

Let me build you a modern version that incorporates voice recording, playback comparison, and real-time pitch analysis. This could be incredibly valuable for learners!
